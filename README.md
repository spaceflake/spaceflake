# 👋 Hi, I’m @spaceflake, also known as Tomas. I'm 38 and live in Gothenburg, Sweden.
👀 I’m in **love** with web development. I also love gaming. Spending some of my spare time on my Xbox, but also play games on PC. 

🌱 I’m currently learning as much as I can. Honing my skills in HTML, CSS and Javascript. I'm dipping my toes in React. I love reading articles about webdesign, mostly on [CSS-tricks](https://css-tricks.com/) and [Smashing Magazine](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/).

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on building websites on a junior level for now.
