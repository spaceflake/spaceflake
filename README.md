- 👋 Hi, I’m @spaceflake, also known as Tomas. I'm 38 and live in Gothenburg.
- 👀 I’m interested in web development. I also love gaming. Spending some of my spare time on my Xbox, but also some games on PC. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning as much as I can. Honing my skills in HTML, CSS and Javascript. I'm dipping my toes in React. I love reading articles about webdesign, mostly on CSS-tricks and Smashing Magazine.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on building out websites on a junior level for now. 
- 📫 How to reach me: email tomasfridekrans@outlook.com
