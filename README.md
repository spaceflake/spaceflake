# 👋 Hi, I’m @spaceflake, also known as Tomas. I'm 39 and live in Gothenburg, Sweden.

Welcome to my little corner of Github.

👀 I’m in **love** with web development. I really like exploring different technologies and taking new approaches to solve problems. Curios by heart and eager to learn.

I also love gaming. Spending some of my spare time on my Xbox, but also play games on PC. 

🌱 I’m currently learning as much as I can. Honing my skills in HTML, CSS and Javascript/Typescript. Other technologies I like React, Next, Svelte.

💞️ I’m looking to for an internship fall 2022.
